# Reading list #
===============================================

All books listed are ones that I have read, am reading, or plan to read in the short-term. Made as part of my 2019 New Years Resolutions and to try and keep myself accountable (we'll see how that goes haha). Additionally, most books listed are kept digitally in my own online library.
